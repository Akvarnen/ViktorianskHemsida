VICTORIAN ERA WEBSITE
This repository contains a website I created as part of a course project, which serves as a "gesällprov" (a practical final assignment). The website explores various aspects of the Victorian era and showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 


WHAT THE PROJECT DOES
This website provides an immersive educational experience about the Victorian era. It contains several pages with rich content, including:

History and Society: A detailed overview of Victorian society, its history and the status of women.
Fashion Through the Decades: Insights into how fashion evolved during the Victorian era, complete with visuals and descriptions.
Beauty: A look at Victorian beauty standards, hair care routines, and skincare practices.
Etiquette: Guidelines on social behavior and manners in different situations, reflecting Victorian customs.
Info Page: General information about the website and its purpose.


WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL
Educational Resource: Perfect for anyone interested in learning about the Victorian era in a structured and visually appealing way.
Showcases Web Development Skills: Demonstrates my ability to create an organized, content-rich website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
